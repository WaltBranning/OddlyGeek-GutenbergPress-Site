 <h1>About TheGutenbergPress @ OddlyGeek</h1>
    <h3>The Beginnings</h3>

    First, this site owes a huge debt of gratitude to [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) this site would not exsist if it wasn't for the work done there. Project Gutenberg is still very much relevant and provides an important service to the preservation of literary history. This site isn't meant to undermine or diminish their work but instead to complement and supplement it.

    That being said, this site actually started as a small script that I wrote for a practice project while getting back into the Python programming language. The purpose of the script was to download books from Project Gutenberg and save them locally. Then I decided to parse the catalog and store a manifest to the local library. One thing just led to another, pretty soon I had the idea to build a portfolio project site as a fun way practical way to refine my skills and challenge me to learn new things. So using the PG catalog as a source of content, TheGutenbergPress@OddlyGeek was born
    
    At first this site was just a mirror to the catalog at PG. Then that changed to, I have always had an interest in literature and have read a number of the classics; that interest is one of the reasons I picked public domain books to begin with. Then after the time I spent with the data from PG I realized there was a niche for promoting some of these old books and providing a place for people to find and read them. Plus, between the Internet Archives and Project Gutenberg there wasn't much of a need for more archiving but an increase in exposure for some forgotten or near forgotten works. And, I hope people find that here, along with some enjoyment, entertainment, and who knows maybe even some enlightenment if that what they are after.
 
    <h2>The Goal</h2>

        The end goal of [TheGutenbergPress](https://www.gutenbergpress.oddlygeek.com/) is to provide a venue for the appreciation of classic literature. Many of these books are quite old, and all the books here are in the public domain, but just because they are old and free doesn't mean that they aren't worth reading. Some of the greatest literary works in history are in fact very old and are still relevant to this day and age.

        Indeed, some of these books have been inspiring readers for generations and their names are still known and still influence writers of today in thier respective genres. Would we have our Captain Jack Sparrows and CSI telvision shows, if it wasn't for books like [Treasure Island](https://www.gutenbergpress.oddlygeek.com/title/120) and [Sherlock Holmes](https://www.gutenbergpress.oddlygeek.com/title/1661). It is easy to see how much those books influenced those whole genres. They are even to this day fun and interesting to read and why they still influence our culture today. Whether the heart felt stories of Charles Dickens, to the adventures of Jules Verne, or the epic [Volsunga Saga](https://www.gutenbergpress.oddlygeek.com/title/1152) of Norse Mythology that has deeply influence the Fantasy genre.    

        These books should not fall into obscurity, it is sad that so many of them already have and that the younger generations haven't heard of many of them. This site wants to be a part of the solution for that. To bring a section of the best of these great works and get them back into the hands of those it could impact, young and old alike and to provide a pleasant user experience that allows the titles more be more accessible and navigable. Instead of being lost in the sheer number of public domain books there are out there.

        While [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) provides the laudable and valuable archival and preservation of humanities literary works, many of the titles serve more historical or scholarly interest and the sheer number of books archived can make navigation and discovery cumbersome. That is why this site's purpose is to provide curated subset of titles. To provide a place to not only preserve but to promote the classics and to dig relevant titles that may have been mostly forgotten in the passage of time.
