        <h3>Education</h3>

        <span class="aside-label">Gadsden State Community College</span>
        <span class="aside-detail small-text">Associates Degree<br>Electronics Engineering Technologies<br>Oct 2001 - May 2004</span>
        <span class="aside-detail aside-text smaller-text">
            During this time, produced a practical understanding along with real-world 
            application of electrical and electronic theory. Learning about the electromagnetic
            principles behind AC/DC circuits, as well as the characteristics of series and 
            parallel circuits, and how resistive, capacitive, and inductive components behave
            in these circuits. Also training in the function of semiconductor and solid-state 
            electronic circuits, such as bridge rectifiers, signal amplifiers, and transistor 
            latches, as well as digital logic circuits and integrated circuits. 
            Additionally, becoming familiar with the visual forms of major electronic components,
            such as resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, and transformers, 
            and was able to recognize them in both schematic representation and physical packaging.
            Furthermore, traingin in troubleshooting equipment with visual inspection
            and detailed schematics, using equipment such as volt-ohm and amp meters,
            oscilloscopes, digital probes, signal tracers, and frequency generators.
            Overall, the time at this school provided a solid and invaluable foundation in electrical 
            and electronic theory and practical skills.

        <h1>One word to summarize my potential and strengths is - Maker.</h1> <p>This word reflects my
    passion for building and creating. Being driven not only by a desire to learn but to apply and use
    that knowledge. Possessing a naturally curious mind that enjoys discovering the why and how
    things work and blessed with an ability to quickly grasp concepts and apply them. This
    ability and a willing eagerness to learn is my greatest strength. <b>Give me a challenge and I will
    rise to meet it.</b></p>  
         <p>Some of relevant past experience has been: Python applications including both online,
    such as websites and API development; as well as local applications including file
    modification batching routines, web scraping, cleaning and parsing data dumps. Including experience developing 
    in Windows but with more familiarity with Linux development environments and work flows; including working from 
    within the CLI and including tools such as ssh, nano, etc, while also using several different IDEs like Visual Studio Code, along with other enviroments
     and tools such as Jupyter-Notebook and ipython.</p>
