        <h4>Software Engineer</h4>
        <div class="separator"><h2></h2></div>
        <p class="summary"><b>Building, Learning, Creating - </b>These words reflect my passion and drive to 
    learn how things work, and then to take that knowledge and apply it. 
    Possessing a naturally curious mind that enjoys discovering the why and how
    things work and blessed with an ability to quickly grasp concepts and apply them. This
    ability along with a willing eagerness to learn, allow for quick adaptation to the meet the
    requirements of the task at hand. <b>Give me a challenge and I will
    rise to meet it.</b></p>  

    <div class="separator"><h2>Professional Summary</h2></div>
        <p class="summary">Developing a solid understanding of the Python language its functionality and 
            methodologies have been my primary focus, and I am most confident in the areas of server side 
            web-development and Python applications. However, in order to build a robust skillset, I have 
            not limited myself to backend but have gained a measure of frontend familiarity and skills.</p>
        <p class="summary">Some relevant past experience has been: Python applications including both online,
    such as websites and API development; as well as local applications including: file
    modification batching routines, web scraping, cleaning and parsing data dumps. Including experience developing 
    in Windows but with more familiarity in Linux development environments and work flows; including working from 
    within the CLI and including tools such as ssh, nano, Git, etc, while also using several different IDEs like Visual Studio Code, along with other enviroments
    and tools such as Jupyter-Notebook and ipython.</p>

                During this time, produced a practical understanding along with real-world 
                application of electrical and electronic theory. Learning about the electromagnetic
                principles behind AC/DC circuits, as well as the characteristics of series and 
                parallel circuits, and how resistive, capacitive, and inductive components behave
                in these circuits. Also training in the function of semiconductor and solid-state 
                electronic circuits, such as bridge rectifiers, signal amplifiers, and transistor 
                latches, as well as digital logic circuits and integrated circuits. 
                Additionally, becoming familiar with the visual forms of major electronic components,
                such as resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, and transformers, 
                and able to recognize them in both schematic representation and physical packaging.
                Furthermore, traingin in troubleshooting equipment with visual inspection
                and detailed schematics, using equipment such as volt-ohm and amp meters,
                oscilloscopes, digital probes, signal tracers, and frequency generators.
                Overall, the time at this school provided a solid and invaluable foundation in electrical 
                and electronic theory and practical skills.
